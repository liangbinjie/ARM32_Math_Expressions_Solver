# ARM32 Assembly to Solve Math Expressions

This project involves developing a program to solve mathematical expressions using ARM assembly language on a Raspberry Pi. The objective is to leverage the low-level programming capabilities of ARM assembly to create an efficient and compact solution for evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware: 
- Raspberry Pi (any model with ARM architecture)
### Software:
- Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian)
- ARM assembly compiler (e.g., as - the GNU Assembler)
- Standard development tools (e.g., gcc for linking, gdb for debugging)

---

## Implementation Goals 

The expression to be solved is provided by the user as a string input. The program should be able to parse the numbers and operands

By using the Reverse Polish Notation, the program can be able to output the results from the expression.
